				Cydia is the main app for the jailbreak. 
				It is the equivalent to the Apple Store.
				You are able to buy paid tweaks/apps here.
				But there are also a ton of free ones that are just as effective. 
				The tweaks can vary from changing the carrier name to changing everything about the iPhone. 
				On this web page is some of the tweaks I installed on my iPhone.

				This tweak is called Springtomize and it hosts a lot of functionality to the iPhone. 
				It is able to change almost everything to do with the animation and layout of the iPhone.
				Some of the things I have it change on my iPhone is the deletion of the Verizon logo and the quick animations so applications load quicker.  
				If you click on the image you can see a preview of the application. 
				If you want to see a demonstration of what this tweak can do to the Control Center view the gif image below.

				F.luz is a great tweak for the night time. 
				Typically, you set the settings once and enjoy it for the rest of your iPhones life. 
				This tweak will change the color temperature of the iPhone to a pleasant and healthy level when it becomes nighttime. 
				There are scientific studies that have proven that the exposure of the blue light that is emitted from the iPhone in dark conditions can be harmful to the eyes. 
				This tweak will automatically change with the time of the to the recommended color temperature.
				This tweak is even going to be incorporated into Apple's next IOS update 9.3 and will be renamed to "Night Shift".

				Recorder is a tweak that does what its name implies. 
				This tweak will act as a screen recorder for easy demonstration of how to’s or preview of game play 
				or like I had used it for this web page by recording the Control Center and then editing the video 
				and then transferring the video into a GIF image. 
				This tweak isn’t useful for everyone but it’s easy to use for the people like me who might need to use it on a rare occasion.
