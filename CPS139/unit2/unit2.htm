			<p><span style="font-weight:bold; display:inline-block;">Car Repairs.</span>
			I have developed a sense of pride when it comes to the repairs on my car. 
			I have found that if I make the repairs myself that I am able to better understand how the whole car functions. 
			With this understanding I have added some perks to the car that others might find to be difficult. 
			Examples:
			</p>
				<!-- I added a unordered list just for an extra challenge -->			
				<ul>
					<li>Install a Remote Starter</li>
					<li>Install and rewire all 4 speakers.</li>
					<li>Install a constant power iPhone charger</li>
					<li>Install LED lighting in front and rear seating areas.</li>
				</ul>
			
			<p><span style="font-weight:bold; display:inline-block;">Jailbroken iPhone.</span>
			A jailbroken iPhone is an iPhone that has been "hacked" so that the internal security has been 
			compromised and unsigned apps/tweaks can be installed without apple's permission. 
			The jailbreaking process is legal and is a most likely the reason Apple's IOS 
			firmware has always been advancing at a very competitive rate. 
			Here's a list of positive reasons why I’ve jailbroken my iPhone:

				<!-- I added a ordered list just for an extra challenge -->
				<ol>
					<li>Able to remove Verizon from the status bar.</li>
					<li>Able to resize and rename any App.</li>
					<li>Able to speed up animations for default responses.</li>
					<li>Able to explore the internal filesystem of IOS.</li>
					<li>Able to use Bluetooth to share files.</li>

			My fiancé and I have recently purchased our first home and it's not 
			considered a "fixer upper" but I want to make some upgrades to make it feel like our home. 
			I have started this by solving a problem we had with our T.V. 
			having to be plugged into an extension cord to be able to reach an outlet. 
			Now the problem is solved after fishing some electrical wire through the wall and 
			adding an outlet box directly behind the T.V. and now there isn't any wires showing.
