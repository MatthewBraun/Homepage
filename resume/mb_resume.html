    <div id="objective">
      <p> I've always been a computer hobbyist and enjoy problem solving. The past couple of years I’ve really enjoyed web development. JavaScript has been very entertaining and has become my favorite programming language. I don’t have a programmer’s job history but I know programming is where I will find my career. I’m located in Dodgeville and currently still enrolled at UW-Platteville online. </p>

        <h2>University of Wisconsin – Stout<span> Transferred May 2017 </span></h2>
        <p> From UW-Richland I transferred to UW-Stout with the goal in mind to obtain a Bachelor of Science degree in Information and Communication Technologies. I started in the summer term to gain early credits and after three semesters decided to change majors. I wanted to transition into a B.S. in Computer Science. I did very well while at <a href="https://www.uwstout.edu">UW-Stout</a> including receiving two Chancellor's Awards for receiving High GPAs. Courses I'd like to highlight are: <ul>
            <li> Web Production and Distribution </li>
            <li> Networking Fundamentals II </li>
            <li> Introduction to Programming </li>
