            Summary
        </h3>
        <p>
            I've always been a computer hobbyist and enjoy problem solving. The past couple of years I’ve really enjoyed web development.
            JavaScript has been very entertaining and has become my favorite programming language. I don’t have a programmer’s
            job history but I know programming is where I will find my career. I’m located in Dodgeville and currently still
            enrolled at UW-Platteville online.

            High school allowed me to explore some different hobbies such as photo editing, movie creating, and woodworking. I still
            dabble in these hobbies to this day.

            Going back to school was challenging but has turned out to be the best decision of my life. Some of the courses I'd like
            to highlight:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Web Page Development

            From UW-Richland I transferred to UW-Stout with the goal in mind to obtain a Bachelor of Science degree in Information and
            Communication Technologies. I started in the summer term to gain early credits and after three semesters decided
            to change majors. I wanted to transition into a B.S. in Computer Science. I did very well while at UW-Stout including
            receiving two Chancellor's Awards for receiving High GPAs. Courses I'd like to highlight are:
            <ul>
                <li> Web Production and Distribution </li>
                <li> Networking Fundamentals II </li>
                <li> Introduction to Programming </li>
                <li> Dynamic Web Technologies</li>
            </ul>

        Currently studying with UW-Platteville's distance education program for a B.S. in Applied
        Computing. It is a new program offered and allows for flexibility in time scheduling due to it
        being 100% online. This semester I have four courses.
        <ul>

            <li>Java Programming</li>
            <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
            <li>Technical And Professional Communication</li>

        I was hired to assist fellow students with their English papers. This provided me with the
        opportunity to talk with and view others perspective of the school experience. I was rehired for

        Followed strict food safety operations. Operated different machines that packaged food products.
        Performed daily routine operations to make adjustments to change from a list of products. This
        job position didn’t provide room for growth and that’s when I decided to go back to school and
