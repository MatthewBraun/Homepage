				<h3>Jailbroken iPhone</h3>
					<p>A jailbroken iPhone is an iPhone that has been "hacked" so that the internal security has been 
					compromised and unsigned apps/tweaks can be installed without Apple's permission. 
					The jailbreaking process is legal and is most likely the reason Apple's IOS 
					firmware has always been advancing at a very competitive rate.

				<h3>House Repairs.</h3>
					<p style="text-align:center;">My fianc√© and I have recently purchased our first home and it's not 
					considered a "fixer upper" but I want to make some upgrades to make it feel like our home. 
					I have started this by solving a problem we had with our T.V. 
					having to be plugged into an extension cord to be able to reach an outlet. 
					Now the problem is solved after fishing some electrical wire through the wall and 
					adding an outlet box directly behind the T.V.

				<h3>Car Repairs</h3>
					<p>I have developed a sense of pride when it comes to the repairs on my car. 
					I have found that if I make the repairs myself that I am able to better understand how the whole car functions. 
					With this understanding I have added some perks to the car that others might find to be difficult.
