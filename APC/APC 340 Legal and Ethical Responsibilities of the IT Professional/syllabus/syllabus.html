<h2><span class="icon-important"></span> Expectations</h2>
<h3>Course Work</h3>
<p>All written work should be formatted with one-inch margins on all sides and single-spaced using a 12-point font. Clarity, grammar and spelling will count in the evaluation of your written assignments and e-mail communications. It is expected that all communications will be prepared and presented in a professional manner.</p>
<h4>Team Project</h4>
<p>Over the course of the semester, you will work as part of a team to develop a code of conduct for a new and fictional IT firm. The instructor will place you on a team. All instructions for the project are posted on D2L.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Online Discussions</h4>
<p>Participation in online discussions is an important component of your grade. One of the best ways to appreciate the ethical and legal issues impacting our profession is to talk them out through thoughtful discussion and deliberation. Each week we will discuss (on D2L) questions/topics related to materials from the text or other readings. Collectively, we will tease out the ethical dilemmas and appropriate potential responses. One of the most important advantages of collaborative learning is the opportunity it provides to interact with others who, like you, are future leaders of industry. Do not deprive yourself of this important opportunity.</p>
<h4>Written Assignments</h4>
<p>During the semester you will complete some written assignments. These include position papers, case analyses, and a statement of your own professional code of ethics. Specific guidance for each of these can be located on D2L along with the rubrics I will use to evaluate your work. Please check the Course Calendar for due dates.</p>
<h4>Final Exam</h4>
<p>The final exam will be an oral exam conducted via Skype. I will work with you to schedule these in the final week of the semester. The exam will be comprised of questions drawn from the coursework and readings. I will assign each question a number. At the start of the exam, you will be asked to choose a set of numbers. I will then ask you the questions which correspond with your selections. I may also ask you follow-up questions based on your initial response to probe for depth of understanding. This allows me to help redirect you should you stray from the intended question. The exam should take approximately 30 minutes to complete.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>I check the message board on D2L several times each day. Barring emergencies, I will respond to your comments or questions posted there within 24 hours. If you have a question or issue which is more urgent, I prefer you email me at <a href="mailto:heathd@uwosh.edu">heathd@uwosh.edu</a>. I will respond as soon as I am able. Should you need to speak with me directly, my cell# is 336-456-5859. You can call or text me at this number with urgent matters. I will likely not answer after 9 p.m., but you can leave me a message or text and I will respond as soon as possible the following morning.</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>For most assignments, you will receive feedback in 4 business days from the due date. Check each individual lesson for where you can find feedback.</p>
<h3>Workload</h3>
<p>This course meets online. Students should expect to spend, in total:</p>
<ul>
<li>40 hours reading the required materials</li>
<li>40 hours participating in online discussions</li>
<li>30 hours completing the project</li>
<li>40 hours completing the assignments</li>
<li>2 hours on the exam</li>
</ul>
<h3>Late Work Policy</h3>
<p>Work should be submitted on or before the day it is due. No assignment turned in later than 24 hours after the time due will receive credit. Late acceptance (prior to 24 hours late) will result in a 25% reduction in the grade for that individual assignment.</p>
<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
<p>At all times, you are expected to abide by the student conduct policies of the University including those regarding academic honesty as outlined in Chapter UWS 14, Wisconsin Administrative Code. Section 14.01 of the code states the following: "Students are responsible for the honest completion and representation of their work, for the appropriate citation of sources, and for respect of others' academic endeavors." Any violation of this policy will be escalated for review and may be punishable by failure on an exam or assignment, failure of this course, or expulsion from the college. All work for this course is to be completed individually unless the work assigned is explicitly identified as collaborative or group work.</p>
<h2>Accessibility Statement</h2>
<p>Students with documented disabilities have the right to request information and necessary accommodations from their University, as stipulated within Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Students interested in requesting academic accommodations must contact the Accessibility Services office at their home campus to begin the application process. Please be advised that the eligibility determination process and, once approved, implementation of accommodation services could take several weeks. It is important for students to be proactive and initiate the process early in order to ensure that accommodations are in place by the time they will be needed.</p>
