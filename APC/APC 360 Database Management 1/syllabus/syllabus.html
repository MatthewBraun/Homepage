<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>This term we will be using Piazza for Q&amp;A. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself.

When you work on lab assignments, it is also possible for me to log into your database account to help you identify the issue if necessary.</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>For most assignments, you will receive feedback in one week. Check each individual lesson for where you can find feedback.</p>
<h3>Workload</h3>
<p>Students should expect to spend 40 hours reading the required readings, 60 hours going through the online course material (audio lectures and self-check quizzes) and 50 hours completing the lab assignments and practice activities for a total of 150 hours.</p>
<h3>Late Work Policy</h3>
<p>No late work is accepted.</p>
