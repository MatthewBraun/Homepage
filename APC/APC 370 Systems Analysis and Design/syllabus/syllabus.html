She started teaching at UW-Platteville in 1995 and moved to Clarke College (now Clarke University) in Dubuque, IA in 2000. That was the year she started working on her PhD as well. She returned to UW-Platteville in 2007 and became chairperson of the Computer Science and Software Engineering department in 2015. She brings to this course her experiences as a systems analyst as well as the wisdom of 20-plus years of teaching.

<h2><span class="icon-important"></span> Expectations</h2>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>I expect if something is not clear you ask. In fact, I make no apologies if my assignments are not clear. When trying to understand what the customer wants, it is rarely clearly articulated. It is your job to clarify and ask questions. So here is a place to start practicing asking good questions and questions that help clarify the desire of the customer.</p>
<p>This term we will be using Piazza for Q&amp;A. The system is designed to get you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza.</p>
<p>On my part, when I am asked a question, I plan to share with the entire group the question and the answer. These will be shared in Piazza. You post anonymously in Piazza (or you can email me). I&rsquo;ll only post the question then to the forum.</p>
<p>I do plan on adding something to the newsfeed weekly. Most likely that will happen over the weekend so be sure you check in early in the week.</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>You can expect that every assignment and project part will have feedback attached. With each lesson there is at least one assignment/project part that is due. It is my intention to give you feedback weekly at a minimum.</p>
<h3>Workload</h3>
<p>Since this is an online course, it is expected that the student will spend approximately 40 hours of required reading, 56 hours of group project work, 46 hours completing assignments and 8 hours for exams (2 exams will be 2 hours and the final exam will be 4 hours).</p>
<h3>Late Work Policy</h3>
<p>Generally I do not accept late work. However there are times when exceptions can be made. These are a case by case determination. You must contact me BEFORE a due date (at least 48 hours) or if an emergency as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>Accessibility Statement</h2>
<p>Students with documented disabilities have the right to request information and necessary accommodations from their University, as stipulated within Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Students interested in requesting academic accommodations must contact the Accessibility Services office at their home campus to begin the application process. Please be advised that the eligibility determination process and, once approved, implementation of accommodation services could take several weeks. It is important for students to be proactive and initiate the process early in order to ensure that accommodations are in place by the time they will be needed.</p>
