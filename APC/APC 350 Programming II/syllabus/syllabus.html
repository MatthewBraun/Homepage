<h2>Accessibility Statement</h2>
<p>Students with documented disabilities have the right to request information and necessary accommodations from their University, as stipulated within Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Students interested in requesting academic accommodations must contact the Accessibility Services office at their home campus to begin the application process. Please be advised that the eligibility determination process and, once approved, implementation of accommodation services could take several weeks. It is important for students to be proactive and initiate the process early in order to ensure that accommodations are in place by the time they will be needed.</p>
